# Analogy (using Syncfusion Winforms UI Library) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Analogy-LogViewer/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/Analogy-LogViewer/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)
Analogy Log Viewer Application (using Syncfusion UI Library). This is Work In Progress. The other version is using DevExpress (V19.1.8) in the other repo: https://github.com/Analogy-LogViewer/Analogy.LogViewer

current status:
- [x] Convert Data Grid Control for messages
- [x] Covert all User Controls (Ribbons, ToolStrips, Windows Forms etc)
- [x] REmove any reference to DevExpress assemblies
- [X] Fix small related UI bugs post conversion to Syncfusion version

Analogy Log Viewer is multi purpose Log Viewer for Windows Operating systems (with built-in NLog Parser and others).

The application has many standard operations for analysis logs (like filtering, excluding) but its strength is in the ability to add additional custom data sources by implementing few interfaces.
This allows adding any logs formats and/or custom modification of logs before presenting the data in the UI Layer.
Some features of this tool are:
1.	Windows event log support (evtx files)
2.	Logs aggregation into single view.
3.	Search in multiple files
4.	Combine multiple files
5.	Compare logs 
6.	Themes support
7.	64 bit support (allow loading more files compare to old tool)
8.	Personalization (users settings per user) 
9.	Columns extension to add more columns specific to the data source implementation
10.	Exporting to Excel/CSV files

Main interaction UI:
- Ribbon area: Log files operations (open) and tools (search/combine/Compare)
- Messages area: File system UI and Main Log viewer area
